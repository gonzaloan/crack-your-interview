# Study Guide

This is a study guide / cheatsheet of whatever I found necessary to know to achieve a good IT role.   

## About the Project

The Study Guide is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator that makes it easy to create and maintain documentation websites. Docusaurus provides a simple and intuitive way to organize and present content, making it an ideal choice for this study guide.

## Getting Started

To run the study guide locally and contribute to the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/gonzaloan/crack-your-interview.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```
npm run start
```

4. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the study guide.

## Project Structure

The project follows the standard Docusaurus project structure:

- `docs/`: Contains the Markdown files for the study guide content.
- `src/`: Contains the custom React components and pages for the website.
- `static/`: Contains static assets such as images and CSS files.
- `docusaurus.config.js`: The main configuration file for Docusaurus.
- `sidebars.js`: Defines the sidebar navigation structure for the study guide.

## Deployment

The study guide is automatically deployed using AWS CodeBuild, CodePipeline, S3 and CloudFront. Whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch, a deployment process is triggered through a pre-configured hook. Here's how it works:

1. AWS CodePipeline, a fully managed continuous delivery service, is triggered to build and deploy the project.

2. A WebHook connected between Github to AWS CodeBuild, detects and uses buildspec.yml file to the build instructions that de AWS service performs.

3. The static files generated by Docusaurus are stored in an S3 bucket, which serves as the origin for the study guide website.

4. AWS CloudFront, a fast content delivery network (CDN), is used to distribute the static files globally and provide low-latency access to the study guide.

The deployed study guide is accessible at [guide.gonzalo-munoz.com](https://guide.gonzalo-munoz.com).
