# Functional Programming in Java

## Overview
Functional Programming (FP) in Java introduces a paradigm shift from imperative to declarative programming, emphasizing immutability, pure functions, and higher-order functions. This section covers advanced FP concepts and their practical applications in enterprise Java development.

## What You'll Learn
- Advanced Stream operations and patterns
- Effective use of Lambda expressions
- Working with Optional for null safety
- Functional interfaces and their applications
- Immutability and pure functions
- Composition and higher-order functions

## Prerequisites
- Solid understanding of Java basics
- Experience with Java collections
- Basic understanding of Object-Oriented Programming

## Key Concepts
1. **Immutability**
    - Thread safety
    - Predictable behavior
    - Side-effect free code

2. **Pure Functions**
    - Deterministic results
    - No side effects
    - Referential transparency

3. **Higher-Order Functions**
    - Functions as parameters
    - Functions returning functions
    - Function composition

4. **Stream Processing**
    - Lazy evaluation
    - Parallel processing
    - Pipeline operations

## Why Functional Programming?
- Cleaner, more maintainable code
- Better support for concurrent programming
- Reduced bugs through immutability
- Improved testability
- More expressive code

## Module Structure
1. **Introduction**
    - Basic concepts
    - Functional interfaces
    - Pure functions

2. **Streams**
    - Advanced operations
    - Custom collectors
    - Parallel processing

3. **Lambda Expressions**
    - Method references
    - Closure scope
    - Best practices

4. **Optional**
    - Null safety
    - Monadic operations
    - Best practices
