# Neo4j Fundamentals: Understanding Graph Databases

## 1. Core Concepts 📊

A graph database represents data through nodes (entities) connected by relationships (edges). Think of it like mapping out connections between people, where each person is a node and their relationships (friendships, family ties, etc.) are the connecting edges.

### Basic Graph Structure

Let's look at how Neo4j represents a simple social network:

```cypher
// Create a person node
CREATE (john:Person {
    name: "John Smith",
    age: 30,
    occupation: "Software Engineer"
})

// Create another person and establish a relationship
CREATE (mary:Person {
    name: "Mary Johnson",
    age: 28,
    occupation: "Data Scientist"
})

// Create a KNOWS relationship between John and Mary
MATCH (john:Person {name: "John Smith"})
MATCH (mary:Person {name: "Mary Johnson"})
CREATE (john)-[:KNOWS {since: "2023-01-15"}]->(mary)
```

### Nodes and Labels

Nodes are the fundamental entities in Neo4j. Think of them as the nouns in your data model. Every node can have one or more labels that describe its role:

```cypher
// Creating nodes with multiple labels
CREATE (post:Content:Post {
    id: "post-123",
    title: "Understanding Graph Databases",
    created: datetime(),
    content: "Graph databases are powerful tools for..."
})

// Adding properties to existing nodes
MATCH (post:Post {id: "post-123"})
SET post.views = 0,
    post.lastModified = datetime()
```

### Relationships

Relationships connect nodes and always have a direction and type. They can also hold properties:

```cypher
// Create nodes and relationships in a single query
CREATE (alice:Person {name: "Alice"})-[:WROTE {
    date: date(),
    wordCount: 1500
}]->(article:Article {
    title: "Graph Theory Basics",
    published: true
})

// Add relationship properties
MATCH (author:Person)-[wrote:WROTE]->(article:Article)
WHERE author.name = "Alice"
SET wrote.revisionCount = 3
```

## 2. Querying Data with Cypher 🔍

Cypher is Neo4j's query language. It uses an ASCII-art style syntax to describe patterns in graphs.

### Basic Pattern Matching

```cypher
// Find all friends of friends
MATCH (person:Person {name: "John Smith"})-[:KNOWS]->(friend)-[:KNOWS]->(friendOfFriend)
WHERE friendOfFriend <> person  // Exclude original person
RETURN DISTINCT friendOfFriend.name

// Find the shortest path between two people
MATCH p=shortestPath(
    (start:Person {name: "John Smith"})-[:KNOWS*]-(end:Person {name: "Alice Brown"})
)
RETURN p
```

### Aggregation and Filtering

```cypher
// Count connections for each person
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:KNOWS]-()
RETURN p.name, count(r) as connectionCount
ORDER BY connectionCount DESC
LIMIT 5

// Find people with mutual connections
MATCH (p1:Person)-[:KNOWS]->(mutual)-[:KNOWS]->(p2:Person)
WHERE p1.name = "John Smith" AND p1 <> p2
RETURN p2.name, count(mutual) as mutualFriends
ORDER BY mutualFriends DESC
```

## 3. Graph Data Modeling 🏗️

Effective graph modeling requires thinking in terms of connected data. Here's a complex example of modeling a social media platform:

```cypher
// Create user profiles
CREATE (user:User {
    id: randomUUID(),
    username: "john_doe",
    email: "john@example.com",
    joinDate: datetime()
})

// Create content nodes
CREATE (post:Post {
    id: randomUUID(),
    content: "Graph databases are amazing!",
    created: datetime()
})

// Create hashtags
CREATE (tag:Hashtag {name: "graphdatabases"})

// Establish relationships
MATCH (user:User {username: "john_doe"})
MATCH (post:Post WHERE post.content CONTAINS "Graph databases")
MATCH (tag:Hashtag {name: "graphdatabases"})
CREATE (user)-[:POSTED {timestamp: datetime()}]->(post)
CREATE (post)-[:TAGGED]->(tag)

// Add interactions
MATCH (post:Post)<-[:POSTED]-(author:User)
MATCH (reader:User {username: "mary_smith"})
CREATE (reader)-[:LIKED {timestamp: datetime()}]->(post)
```

## 4. Indexing and Constraints 🎯

Proper indexing is crucial for graph database performance:

```cypher
// Create unique constraint on User.email
CREATE CONSTRAINT unique_user_email IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (user:User) REQUIRE user.email IS UNIQUE

// Create index on Post.created
CREATE INDEX post_date_index IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (p:Post) ON (p.created)

// Composite index on multiple properties
CREATE INDEX user_location_index IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (u:User) ON (u.country, u.city)
```

## 5. Graph Algorithms 🧮

Neo4j provides built-in graph algorithms for advanced analysis:

```cypher
// PageRank to find influential users
CALL gds.pageRank.stream('social-graph')
YIELD nodeId, score
MATCH (p:Person) WHERE id(p) = nodeId
RETURN p.name, score
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 10

// Community detection
CALL gds.louvain.stream('social-graph')
YIELD nodeId, communityId
MATCH (p:Person) WHERE id(p) = nodeId
RETURN p.name, communityId
ORDER BY communityId
```

## 6. Data Import and Export 📤

Handling bulk data operations:

```cypher
// Load CSV data
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///users.csv' AS row
CREATE (user:User {
    id: row.id,
    name: row.name,
    email: row.email
})

// Export query results
CALL apoc.export.csv.query(
    "MATCH (u:User)-[:POSTED]->(p:Post) 
     RETURN u.name, p.content, p.created",
    "user_posts.csv",
    {}
)
```

## 7. Performance Optimization 🚀

Tips for optimizing query performance:

```cypher
// Use EXPLAIN to see query plan
EXPLAIN MATCH (p:Person)-[:KNOWS*1..3]-(connected:Person)
WHERE p.name = "John Smith"
RETURN connected.name

// Use parameters instead of literal values
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE p.name = $name
RETURN p

// Efficient path finding with directed relationships
MATCH (start:Person {name: $name})-[:KNOWS*1..2]->(connected:Person)
RETURN DISTINCT connected.name
```

## 8. Monitoring and Maintenance 🔧

Keeping your graph database healthy:

```cypher
// Check database statistics
CALL db.stats.retrieve()

// Monitor active queries
CALL dbms.listQueries()

// Kill long-running query
CALL dbms.killQuery($queryId)

// View index usage
CALL db.indexes()
```
