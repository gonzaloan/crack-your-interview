# Clean Code Introduction

## What is Clean Code?
Clean Code is code that is easy to understand and easy to change. It's not about whether the code works â€“ it's about whether it's easy to read, maintain, and modify.

## Key Principles
- Code should be readable and meaningful
- Each function should do one thing well
- Keep functions and classes small and focused
- Comments should explain "why", not "what"
- Follow consistent formatting and naming conventions

## Benefits
- Easier maintenance
- Fewer bugs
- Faster development
- Better team collaboration
- Lower technical debt
