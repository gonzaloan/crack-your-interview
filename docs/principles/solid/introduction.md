# SOLID Principles in Software Design

## What are SOLID Principles?

SOLID is a mnemonic acronym that represents five fundamental principles of object-oriented programming and design:

- **S**: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **O**: Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
- **L**: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **I**: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **D**: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

## Why are SOLID Principles Important?

Understanding and applying SOLID principles helps you:
- Write more maintainable code
- Create more flexible software
- Build scalable applications
- Reduce technical debt
- Make testing easier

## Common Interview Questions

1. **Basic Understanding**
    - "Can you explain what SOLID principles are?"
    - "Why are SOLID principles important in software development?"

2. **Implementation**
    - "How have you applied SOLID principles in your previous projects?"
    - "Can you identify SOLID violations in this code snippet?"

3. **Trade-offs**
    - "When might you choose not to follow a SOLID principle?"
    - "How do you balance SOLID principles with practical considerations?"

## Preparation Tips

- Study each principle individually
- Practice identifying violations
- Work on refactoring exercises
- Prepare real-world examples
- Understand the relationships between principles
